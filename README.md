# MyDocumentManager
Simple document manager to keep track of all my documents spread everywhere in many duplicates.
This project is an attempt to develop something useful for us that have no control over all the documents we produce, always looking for a specific document without finding it. At the moment I use Agent Ransack to find documents I am looking for, using some word in the text as key, but that is not good enough. I will also use this project to test the Github Copilot that I now have access to :)

This project is still in design phase, I am trying to find a design that works.
